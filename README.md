### Hi there, I'm **[Thibault][about]** 👋

I bring over a decade of expertise, working my way from Thales to [Symphony][symphony], and I'm passionate about coding and solving technical challenges.

Currently, I serve as the Lead Software Engineer at Symphony, a pioneering end-to-end encrypted chat platform. My interests span a wide spectrum, with a focus on Java, Spring Boot, Docker, and an API-First Approach. Also learning [Go][openhue-cli] on my free time.  

🌐 Creator and Maintainer of the [OpenHue][openhue] Project 🔗 on [GitHub][openhue-gh]

Let's connect and explore the world of code together!
