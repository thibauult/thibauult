### Hi there, I'm **[Thibault](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thibault-pensec)** 👋

I bring over a decade of expertise, working my way from Thales to Symphony.com, and I'm passionate about coding and solving intricate technical challenges.

🚀 Currently, I serve as the Lead Software Engineer at Symphony, a pioneering end-to-end encrypted chat platform. My interests span a wide spectrum, with a focus on Java, Go, Docker, and an API-First Approach. I'm deeply committed to open-source projects.

🌟 I take pride in driving the improvement of developer experiences and tooling, and I'm here to support others in achieving their objectives.
